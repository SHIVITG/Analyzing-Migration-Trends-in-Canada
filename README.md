## Project Abstract
The "Shifting Sands of Canada" project aims to analyze changing interprovincial migration trends in Canada from 1971 to 2022. The investigation focuses on yearly and quarterly migration patterns, examining preferences for migration timing, favored and less favored provinces, and evolving migration trends. This research provides insights into population mobility within Canada with applications in economics, sociology, policy development, and urban planning.
