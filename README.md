# Analyzing-Migration-Trends-in-Canada

PROJECT ABSTRACT 
Topic - Shifting Sands of Canada: Analyzing Changing Interprovincial Migration Trends 

This project focuses on investigating interprovincial migration in Canada from 1971 to 2022, with a specific emphasis on migration patterns on both a yearly and quarterly basis. We aim to explore whether people prefer to migrate during specific times, the provinces that are less favored and those that attract the most migrants, and whether migration trends have changed over the decades. This research will provide valuable insights about the movement of people within the country and can become a rich resource for studying Canada's population mobility, with applications in economics, sociology, policy development, and urban planning.

Dataset Details: 

Data Source: Estimates of interprovincial migrants by province or territory of origin and destination, quarterly and yearly in Canada from 1971 to 2022. 	 

About Dataset: This comprehensive dataset provides valuable information on the migration patterns of individuals and families across Canada from 1971 to 2022. It specifically focuses on interprovincial migration, tracking the movement of people between different provinces and territories. This dataset is a crucial resource for understanding the dynamics of population movement within Canada over several decades. 

Data Fields: 

The dataset typically includes the following key data fields: 

Year: The time period indicating the specific year in which the migration occurred.  

Quarter: The time period indicating the specific quarter in which the migration occurred. 

Province or Territory of Origin: The province or territory from which migrants originated. This includes data on the number of individuals or families moving out of each province. 

Province or Territory of Destination: The province or territory to which migrants are relocating. This includes data on the number of individuals or families moving into each province. 

Number of Migrants: The total count of individuals or families moving from the destination to the specified quarter. 

==================================================================== 

Hypothesis: 

Hypothesis 1: People tend to migrate more frequently either yearly or quarterly between Canadian provinces. 

Hypothesis 2: Certain provinces consistently attract more migrants and can be recognized as the most favorable destinations both annually and quarterly. 

Hypothesis 3: Certain provinces consistently attract less migrants and can be recognized as the least favorable destinations both annually and quarterly. 

Hypothesis 4: There is a changing trend in interprovincial migration patterns over the years, reflecting evolving factors that influence people's decisions to relocate within Canada.
